Boggis: Welcome to Riverrock Estate, your new farm is down south of here — she’s a bit rough ‘round the edges, but nothing you can’t handle.
Boggis: I’ve been sweeping the dust out of your old farmhouse, but I reckon your cows and chickens are starting to eye me for dinner. They’re that hungry.
Boggis: You’ll need some good crops to keep ‘em fed and happy. Animals around here can be picky eaters, y’know.
Boggis: Here, a little welcome gift. Fresh seeds, straight from my garden. Plant ‘em well and you’ll be rolling in feed in no time.
- Take crop seeds 
	Dean: Yeah I can grow some crops. 
	do GameDialogueManager.action_give_crop_seeds() 
- No I don't want them.
	Dean: I am not ready to grow my farm yet.
